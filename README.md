# Intro to Go for javascript developers

For javascript developers looking forward to learning Go

### History

The Go programming language was created by some awesome developers at Google, generally they wanted a language that had 3 main properties:

1. Fast compile time
2. Ease of development
3. Fast execution

All 3 of these were hard to find in a programming language, Go was created to be that language.

Go has all of the mentioned properties above.
1. It has a very fast compile time.
2. Ease of development as it reduces many of the complexities that come with C
3. Fast execution
